        <h1>THE DARK WEB</h1>
        <h3>
            A place to stay anonymous and visit any encrypted online content 
            allowing individuals to hide their identity and location from <br>
            <b>EYES BLEEDING TO SEE IT</b>
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This is the place to go to stay hidden, to do and know you are not being watched,
             and act based on your intuition
        </p>

        <h2>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>
        <p>
            The dark web lurks beneath the surface of the internet, hidden from conventional search engines and 
            accessible only through special software like <b>Tor</b>. It's a shadowy realm where anonymity reigns, 
            masking users' identities and locations. Here, encrypted websites house a maze of illicit 
            activities—drug trafficking, weapons deals, stolen data markets, and more. Unlike the surface web, 
            which is easily accessible, the dark web thrives on secrecy, with its onion-like structure allowing 
            users to remain hidden. But beware—venturing too deep can lead to dangerous encounters, as this hidden 
            world is filled with both deception and lurking threats.
